\section{The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents}


\subsection{}
\subsubsection{\Gls{Mauri} and the rodents try to reason with their human accomplice}
In a carriage headed to Uberwald, \Gls{Mauri} tries to argue with someone else that the scam they
are running is ethically justifiable, since they take money away from governments who might put it
to use for violent wars. The driver feels spooked by the low squeaky voices he can hear coming from
the coach, even through there is only one passenger left. Eventually, a highwayman stops them in the
rainy night, and asks for their bag of cash.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Mauri} turns the tables on a bandit who tries to waylay his coach}
The boy tells the bandit that the money is on a sack tied to the roof, just as \Gls{Mauri} the cat
asks him to play a warning note on his flute to warn the rats. \Gls{Peach}, the head rat, tells
\Gls{Mauri} that they cannot steal the coach even if the driver has fled, and \Gls{Mauri} settles
for stealing the bandit's horse. The boy gets down from the carriage, and takes the horse, as
the bandit remains very still, waiting for the rats to scurry out of his trousers.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Mauri} thinks back to his sudden sentience in the garbage dump behind
    Unseen University}
\Gls{Mauri} recalls gaining sentience one day, when he looked into a puddle in the garbage dump
behind Unseen University, and understood the idea of self. He then thinks about finding the rats
living in the same dump also being sentient, and coming up with the idea of the rat-catching scam
that uses the flute-playing boy. The party reach the outskirts of a small village, and \Gls{Mauri}
is forced to field further questions from the rats.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Mauri} reminds the sentient rats about their long-term goal}
\Gls{Mauri} fends off questions from \Gls{Beans}, a young albino rat that was born just after the
Awakening, as the old leader \Gls{Hamn} sits back and struggles with his newfound intelligence.
\Gls{Mauri} reminds them that their grand plan of starting a new civilization on a deserted island
requires a hefty investment, and that he represents their best shot of fulfilling their dream.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Mauri} is forced to put an end to his rat-catching scam after the next town}
\Gls{Peach} and \Gls{Beans} make an appeal to \Gls{Hamn} to end the usual scam with this next town,
and set off to find the boats for their voyage after splitting the spoils with \Gls{Mauri}. When the
boy offers no objection to \Gls{Beans}, \Gls{Mauri} decides to make their final scam a grand affair.
\Gls{Peach} sets the bandit's horse loose, since they cannot sell it in town without raising
suspicion.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Mauri} and the young boy notice food rationing in the town}
At the town square, \Gls{Mauri} notices the townsfolk staring at him, as the boy points out how the
villagers look much poorer than the architecture might suggest. They spot a notice board announcing
a handsome reward for rat tails, and spot some watchmen controlling a long queue at the town's
rat-house. \Gls{Mauri} wanders into the building, and finds food being rationed strictly for the
townsfolk.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Mauri} and the boy run into some rat-catchers}
The boy plays some music for the people standing in line, as \Gls{Mauri} comes out of the building,
to spot two rat catchers approaching with their bags of rat-tails. The rat catchers' dogs are cowed
by \Gls{Mauri} speaking human words to them, as one of the rat-catchers drops a bundle of tails on
the ground. When the boy goes to pick them up, the rat-catcher warns him about the possibility of
getting the plague from the tails, and brushes off the questions about why they don't fear touching
the tails themselves.

\subsubsection{A villager offers to purchase \Gls{Mauri} so that he can catch more rats}
A villager comes out of the ration house, and asks to buy \Gls{Mauri} off the boy. The boy refuses,
and the villager reminds him that money does not mean much in the town with its food scarcity.
\Gls{Mauri} suggests staying in town and uncovering the scam that is clearly in progress, and
reassures the boy that \Gls{Hamn} can deal with the rat-catchers on his own.

\subsubsection{A girl in black identifies \Gls{Mauri} as an enchanted cat that can talk}
A girl wearing black notices the boy talking to \Gls{Mauri}, and asks him why he is in town. She
makes up a story about the boy being a wizard's apprentice who got sick of his workplace and stole
the enchanted cat on his way out. She catches \Gls{Mauri} talking when she spooks him by saying that
the villager probably wanted to buy him for food rather than catching rats.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Peach} and the leaders set up a base of operations underneath the town}
\Gls{Peach} lights a small candle in a cellar underneath the town, as the rats gather for their
debriefing. \Gls{Hamn} refuses to bother with the finer details of the plan, and leaves the
organizing to \Gls{Beans}, who claims to have enough eyesight left to tell the candlelight from the
darkness. \Gls{Darktan}, the engineer rat, points out that the town has no rats in the dark tunnels
so suitable for their lifestyle.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Darktan} gives orders to the three groups of rats in the clan}
\Gls{Darktan} sends off a group of juvenile rats to urinate on the food-grain stores in the town,
and turns to the group of older rats, who are tasked with stealing food from the kitchens. He then
turns to the final group, consisting of the trap disposal and detection rats, who are to survey the
town and get rid of as many traps as possible before the others groups can get to work.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Peach} continues filling in her scroll of laws laid down by \Gls{Beans}}
\Gls{Peach} writes down a new edict formulated by \Gls{Beans}, which states that rats should not
kill other rats. She thinks back to how the senior rats all listened to him, now that they were in
unfamiliar cognitive territory. She then goes off to find \Gls{Hamn} isolating himself from the
other rats, seemingly trying to fight off some disease caused by his old age.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Malicia} introduces herself to \Gls{Mauri} and the boy \Gls{Keith}}
The girl in black takes \Gls{Mauri} and the boy to her home, and tells them that her father is
the town's mayor. She talks about the food rationing as a result of the rat infestation, and how
this has destroyed the town's bustling tourism industry. \Gls{Mauri} asks her for her name, and
she tells him it is \Gls{Malicia}. The boy reveals for the first time that his name is \Gls{Keith},
and that he was an orphan raised by the Ankh-Morpork Guild of Musicians.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Malicia} immediately works out \Gls{Mauri}'s scam}
\Gls{Malicia} tells \Gls{Mauri} that she has a fairly comfortable life as the mayor's daughter, but
for the strict rationing of food. \Gls{Mauri} notices \Gls{Sardines} rappelling down from the
kitchen roof behind \Gls{Malicia}, and tries desperately to signal for a retreat. \Gls{Sardines}
gets caught in a trap, and is rescued by \Gls{Keith} just in time for the spiky jaws to snap shut.
\Gls{Malicia} connects the dots, and theorizes that the intelligent rats are a part of the scam
being perpetrated by \Gls{Keith}, with help from \Gls{Mauri}.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Sardines} talks about how unusual the town is compared to all their previous
    venues}
\Gls{Sardines} remarks on the curious absence of native rats in the town, and \Gls{Malicia} asks him
if he is excluding his own clan of intelligent rats from the count. \Gls{Malicia} hears
\Gls{Sardines} talk about the local rats in all the other towns they go to, and of how they can
be made to comply with \Gls{Mauri}'s plan. \Gls{Mauri} points out that the rat-catchers have been
passing off shoelaces as rat tails, with a story about the plague acting as a safeguard against
close examination.

\subsection{}
\subsubsection{\Gls{Darktan} receives bad news during one of his trap defusal demonstrations}
\Gls{Darktan} demonstrates a tricky trap defusal to the novices in his squad, with \Gls{Nouri}
quickly realizing she is out of her depth when it comes to remembering the intricate details of each
model. \Gls{Darktan} pencils in the trap on his map, as he receives reports of the local mundane
rats lying dead next to the poisoned food in the tunnels. A runner from the urination squad runs to
\Gls{Darktan} with reports of a new model of trapped one of his squadmates.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Malicia} proposes a raid of the rat-catchers' shed at night}
\Gls{Malicia} tells \Gls{Mauri} and \Gls{Keith} that her father has received a lot of complaints
from the townsfolk regarding a fresh wave of rats, and has sent for the two rat-catchers. She
suggests breaking into the rat-catchers' shed and learning about the fake rat-tails that they are
using to abuse the bounty that has been declared.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Darktan} observes the advanced trap after one of the scouts dies to it}
\Gls{Darktan} comes to the new trap, and notices the others in the squad wondering what happens to
the self after death, and mumbling something about the \Gls{DRat} ready to take them to the
afterlife. He warns them not to venture further into the tunnel with the sophisticated trap, and
wonders why there is so much more poison than live local rats.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Darktan} comes up against a new kind of paralytic poison in the tunnels}
\Gls{Darktan} returns to the tunnel hub, to be dragged to be shown another rat that has died to a
new poison that causes paralysis. He asks for a live trap to be brought so that it can be
euthanized, and is exasperated when news comes of a live native rat being spotted after many days
searching under the town.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Malicia} picks the lock of the rat-catchers' office}
\Gls{Malicia} leads the way through the city streets to the rat-catchers' office, which is heavily
padlocked. She takes out a bent hairpin from her bag of tools, as \Gls{Mauri} watches on in
fascination. She manages to pick the lock before he can finish his statement about how this was a
real-life lock, and not one from her fairy tales.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Hamn} lets \Gls{Darktan} deal with the new trap}
\Gls{Hamn} and the other leaders let \Gls{Beans} interrogate the native rat, as \Gls{Darktan}
recalls smelling a large population of rats close to the place where it was found. \Gls{Hamn}
decides not to strike against \Gls{Beans} for suggesting they keep the native rat as a pet, and lets
\Gls{Darktan} dictate the strategy for the expedition into the hidden rat farm. \Gls{Peach} and the
other senior rats are surprised that \Gls{Hamn} is so diplomatic all of a sudden, in contrast with
his animal instincts.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Keith} falls through a secret trapdoor in the rat-catchers' shed}
\Gls{Malicia} insists on finding a secret passage inside the rat-catchers' shed, and tries to lean
on the walls hoping to trigger some sort of secret switch. \Gls{Keith} wanders the shed, noticing
that the sugar was being stored right next to the rat poisons, until he runs into a small rat-hole
in a wall. \Gls{Malicia} pulls a lever inside the rat-hole, causing \Gls{Keith} to fall through a
trapdoor.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Darktan} remains cautious in tracking down the rat-farm}
\Gls{Darktan} uses one of the few remaining mechanical rat toys to scout a tunnel leading to a wide
drainpipe. The toy gets caught in a trap, and \Gls{Hamn} starts to lose patience with the slow pace
of the expedition. \Gls{Darktan} points out that the warn tunnels are used to pump geothermal water
to the town's baths. \Gls{Hamn} smells some poison, and agrees with \Gls{Darktan}'s suggestion to
let another native rat run away when it sees them coming.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Darktan} and \Gls{Hamn} prepare to scout the rat-farm}
\Gls{Darktan} takes out a small spike crafted for him by \Gls{Keith}, and points out the sword that
was in the picture book of animal stories that they had stolen shortly after Awakening. \Gls{Hamn}
insists on being part of the vanguard, anxious to prove his dominant position in the clan to
potential challengers like \Gls{Darktan}.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Keith} and \Gls{Malicia} explore the underground cellar stocked with food}
\Gls{Keith} falls on some sacks of grain, and points out a ladder for \Gls{Malicia} to use as she
looks down through the trapdoor. \Gls{Mauri} tries to make sense of the hoarded food in the cellar,
and how the rat-catchers seemed too dumb to pull off such an elaborate scam. \Gls{Malicia} is
convinced that the rat-catchers have simply killed off all the rats and hoarded the food for
themselves.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Keith} is reunited with \Gls{Hamn} and the rat leaders in the rat-farm}
\Gls{Keith} wonders why the shed has lots of wire-netting, given that dead rats do not need to be
caged. \Gls{Mauri} runs into \Gls{Sardines} scurrying out of a door at the other end of the cellar,
talking about some evil thing that requires all of them to come look. \Gls{Peach} and \Gls{Beans}
watch most of the exploring rats run past them as they flee the cellar. \Gls{Hamn} and \Gls{Darktan}
stay in the rat-farm, as \Gls{Keith} breaks down the door to let in \Gls{Malicia}.

\subsubsection{The rat catchers enter the rat-farm, and confront \Gls{Keith}}
\Gls{Mauri} hears someone coming down the ladder and tells everyone to run for their lives. He
runs into a small drain-pipe in the darkness, as the rat-catchers confront the two kids.
\Gls{Malicia} accuses them of hoarding the town's food supply, and asks them who their boss is. They
knock her out after getting tired of her chattering, and turn to \Gls{Keith}. After \Gls{Keith}
tries and fails to hit them, he is left with a broken flute and bleeding lips.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Mauri} watches the rat-catchers deal with \Gls{Hamn}}
\Gls{Mauri} watches the rat-catchers grab \Gls{Hamn} when he tries to save \Gls{Keith}, and take him
to the special cage full of hardy cannibalistic rats. \Gls{Hamn} manages to summon his inner rage to
keep the few remaining rats wary, and the rat-catchers wonder how he will do at the nightly
rat-hunts where other rat-catchers set their terriers against hordes of rats.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Mauri} struggles with a disembodied voice of a rat God}
\Gls{Mauri} listens to the rat-catchers talk about some expensive rat-piper that the mayor is due
to hire soon, as a mysterious force causes them to suddenly find it a good idea. He watches the
rat-catchers drag the children out of the rat-farm, and is left to find a way out through the dark
tunnels. He listens to the same disembodied voice asking him who he is, and turn hostile when it
realizes he is a cat.

\subsubsection{\Gls{Mauri} narrowly escapes the rat terminators hunting him down}
\Gls{Mauri} manages to resist the hypnotic voice long enough to crawl into an underground sewage
pit that leaves him caked in fermented mud. He figures out that the voice can see through his eyes,
and shuts them. He leaps onto the roof using a collapsed beam, and manages to avoid the rat
terminators trying to hunt him down since his own scent is masked by the sewage.
